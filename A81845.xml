         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SEVERAL PROPOSALS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THat thoſe that did lend Moneys, Horſe or Arms, or ought elſe, upon the Propoſitions in or about the year 1642. and have continued to aſſiſt the Parliament and Army upon the account of truth and peace, may now be freed from further charge; and if poſſible, that they may be paid, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that are not able to forbear it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe that have not lent, may be invited to lend the fifth and twentieth part; and that a ſufficient number be appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and that it may be for the payment of the ſouldiers, that hereby, all may be equal in lending.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That thoſe that are much encreaſed in their outward Eſtates ſince they firſt did lend, may be invited to make ſome reaſonable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That thoſe that have been ſatisfied their monies lent, by Lands or otherwiſe, be now again invited to lend the 8th &amp; 20th part.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That all thoſe Lands that have been purchaſed or given from, or by the Commonwealth or Parliament, may be double in the Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that thereby the Lands of all well-affected men under 40 <hi>l.</hi> a year, may not be aſſeſſed any longer; yet that all men may be aſſeſſed for their ſtock of money, beſide the ſtock they uſe in their Trades or farming. And that all their Lands that have not aſſiſted the Parliament, but in any thing acted to the contrary, that their Lands be double in the Aſſeſment, to thoſe that did aſſiſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Army.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That all Houſes and Lands that are the Commonwealths, and can be ſpared from needful uſes, as namely <hi>White hall,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may be ſold to pay the Souldiers, and publike faith money, lent in 1642. and 43. or about that time.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Officers in the Army may be reduced to as ſmall a number as may be, and that they be contented (eſpecially in times of peace) with leſs pay: for the people and private ſouldiers are much offended at the pomp and pride of ſome Officers.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:119459:2"/>
            <p n="8">8. That the private ſouldiers may be duely payed every month.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That there may be Regiſters, one or more in every County, that by them all Wills, Sales, (of any conſiderable value) and all Bills and Bonds, Conveyances and Morgages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be regiſtred at a reaſonable price, ſo that every man may ſee what is his, and what is anothers; and to prevent ſuits at Law, which now are and have been very vexatious, hazardous, and chargeable.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That there may be peace-makers appointed in every County, that may have power given them to hear and determine all matters in variance, and to give Judgement <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there be no going to Law one with another.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That thoſe peace-makers may give and ſend our Summons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Writs, &amp; that there be no Areſts but after thoſe Summons: that no Conveyance of any Lands or Goods, made by the parties, be good, but null, except it be with the peace-makers conſent, for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the party complaining: provided that the Tryal may not hold above one month after the Summons.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That all Laws that are Tyrannical, or that thereby the people may and have been ſnared and oppreſſed, in conſcience or otherwiſe, may be taken away; all Deodands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. That care be taken that all Monies or Lands given for Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſes, be diſpoſed of to Gods glory; and not be imbezzel'd, nor continued to any ſuperſtitious or idolatrous uſe or uſes.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That all Copy-holders may be at a reaſonable rent by the Acre, for their Lands, without Fine or Bond-ſervices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. That the people be left free to chuſe and maintain their own Miniſters reſpectively, to preach to them; provided they be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemies to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and that they meddle not with State-matters to diſturb others.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That all impoſitions by way of Tythes, be taken away and aboliſhed; and if any be diſſatisfied therewith, let them read the <hi>Husband-mans Plea,</hi> and <hi>Hartfordſhire Petition,</hi> exhibited many years ſince to the Parliament, and <hi>Anthony Perſon,</hi> and other late Writers.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That none that do live in the fear of God, and are ſent as by his immediate power into the Miniſtery, may in the leaſt be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or outwardly diſturbed, nor others in the time of their ſpeaking; and that none be faulted for ſpeaking one to another.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That there may be no obſervation of dayes or places impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon tender <hi>Conſciences,</hi> nor nothing forced from them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe meeting places they make no uſe of, but rather, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119459:3"/>may be united, that ſuch meeting places and <hi>Churches</hi> (falſly ſo called) as may be ſpared, may be work-houſes, for the better ſetting the poor on work, and relieving thoſe that are not able to work: and that there may be ſpecial care taken for the better relief of the poor and impotent.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That all ſwearing, whoring, Theft, Murther, and all other wickedneſs and ideleneſs, and Pride, as much as may be, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and ſuppreſſed in whomſoever, without partiality.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That there may be a Model of Civil Government and Laws in ſhort, ſet out and declared to the People, that all may ſet their hands to it; and thoſe that cannot for the preſent, let them have three or ſix months time given them, to give in their Reaſons to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Parliament, that ſo there may be a general and particular Agreement among the people, of all Civil Laws and Government in outward things; and that no Laws be in force, but what ſhall from time to time, be made and agreed upon, by the Keepers of the Liberties of the People, and the people by ſubſcribing their Names as aforeſaid: and that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <div type="part">
               <head>The NARRATIVE of the Propoſer, as followeth.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> was, for refuſing to pay the Ship-money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 2640. ſtrayed three times, and at laſt forced to go in his own Arms againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> when the late King intended to force a new Book of Common Prayer upon them: but with much ado, the ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> prevailed with the Leaders or Commanders to accept of a man in his room, which he was forced to hire at a great rate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi>'s Innovations, for refuſing to kneel at the rails, the Table being ſet up Altar-wiſe at the eaſt end, he was kept a long time in the Commiſſaries Court, &amp; Arches, at great expences, &amp; Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from <hi>Ipſwich</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> vexations troubles &amp; charges; &amp; there a <hi>Significavit</hi> and Excommunica ion came out againſt me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was damnified about 300 <hi>l.</hi> whereupon my ſelf, and two Men more in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> did Petition the Parliament againſt Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lambe,</hi> and his Commiſſary, his innovations; and for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as I have heard, the Committee of that Parliament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119459:3"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Witherington</hi> was then Chair-man, had drawn up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be made to the Houſe for 300 <hi>l.</hi> apiece Reparations; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the King did challenge the five or ſix Members, and thereupon the diſturbance did grow ſo great, that we could have no proceedings. Our Petition and attendance with Witneſſes, and ſeveral Journies of our ſelves and Witneſſes, from about <hi>Ipſwich</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> was a very great trouble and charge to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. About that time, the King went from the Parliament to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market;</hi> and whilſt he was there, we had an Aſſizes at <hi>Bury S. Edmunds</hi> (ſo called) in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> at which Aſſizes my ſelf, and one man more in <hi>Ipſwich</hi> (who ſince dyed in the Parliaments ſervice, a Captain) did draw a Petition to the King, ſhewing that the great grievance of the Country was, his not returning to the Parliament; and ſaid in it, That <hi>if there were any in the Parliament that had offended any known Law of this Nation, that they might be brought to a fair tryal, according to Law,</hi> &amp;c. And with our diligence about that Petition, it was ſigned by the Grand Jury, and moſt of the Juſtices: as I remember, by all upon the Bench except one, as alſo by a numberleſs number of the hands of the whole County, it being a very great Aſſizes: and three, a Knight, and two other Juſtices for the County were appointed to carry that Petition to the King, to <hi>New-market,</hi> and were juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their coaches to go to <hi>New market;</hi> and then the King hearing of it, he did ſend a Meſſenger or Meſſage, That no Petition ſhould be brought to him, at the peril of the Bringers. But then my ſelf and ſome others did go to Judge <hi>Crook</hi> his chamber, and deſired him to deliver our Petition to the King: he did read it, and receive it, and promiſed that if it were poſſible, he would deliver it to him; but ſoon after, we did hear that the King went to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and refuſed all Petitions and Invitations from the Parliament and People; and in a ſhort time, as we did hear, he ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and raiſed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt his Parliament, and well-affected people: Whereupon the Parliament did in their juſt defence raiſe an Army againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon this account from time to time I have acted, &amp; have been imployed in the ſervice in brief, as follows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My ſelf, my own Father, and Wives Father did lend upon the propoſitions and publike Faith, about 300 <hi>l.</hi> moſt of all which was at laſt my loſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My ſelf continued a dayly Actor in ſending out Horſ-men and Arms; and after a ſhort time, my ſelf and three more had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſent us from the then Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> to ſecure and diſ-arm all that had not aſſociated and lent upon the publike Faith: by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

                  </gap>led, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but had got few or none: then he, the ſaid Protector, deſired me to ſtay a while, and make uſe of my Commiſſion there: which I did, and in a ſhort time we raiſed a conſiderable number of horſe, arms and money: But becauſe I did know that the County of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> was left in a dangerous condition, I returned back, and refuſed no ſervice for the good of the Commonwealth and County, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſending Horſe and Arms to the late Protector &amp; Parliaments Army: and upon Letters from the late Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> directed and ſent to me, I did from time to time ſend him alſo honeſt able men; ſome by his Letter, to <hi>Ely,</hi> to Col. <hi>Walton</hi> there: and thoſe men were ſent out at my own coſt and charge. If I miſtake not, I did ſend from <hi>Ipſwich</hi> among divers other men, the late deceaſed General <hi>Blake,</hi> and others that are dead, and many of them alive, that have been very ſerviceable; and from time to time, I did entertain ſouldiers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and divers others, related to, and members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Army, at my own coſt and charge. And I was made high Collector for the very firſt Aſſeſment, when no man durſt do it, and was forced to go to ſeveral places with a party of Horſe, at my own coſt and charge, to force ſome ill-affected to pay their Aſſeſments. And I was continued high Collector in all the moſt troubleſome times, until the year 1651. and in thoſe dayes it was a very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, dangerous and troubleſome office, and ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt part of the time, there was no treaſurer that did act in that County: whereby, and by reaſon of the unrulineſs and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſouldiers at ſome time, I was expoſed to very great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and loſſes; To inſtance but in two or three, namely, Not long before the great Army went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> Captain <hi>Chillenden,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Diſher</hi> and Lt. <hi>Sheres</hi> did get by force, and by cunning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit from me ſeveral ſums, as followeth; which of right, do belong to the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Captain <hi>Chillenden</hi> from time to time, by his cunning and flattering words, would have what monies he did come for, with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119459:4"/>Warrants for Col. <hi>Whaley</hi>'s Regiment; and a little before their going into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> after he had received his money upon a Warrant for that Regiment, he told me that he had one Warrant more, to receive as I remember about 2200 <hi>l.</hi> as he ſaid it was for the Committee for the Army. Alderm <hi>Allen,</hi> and others with him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired me to let him have what I could poſſibly upon that Warrant, and uſed many arguments to perſwade me, and ſaid that what monies I did let him have upon that warrant, was almoſt as good as given him: for he was buying of Fee-farme-rents, and could make uſe of that money a long time. Whereupon I did at that time let him have, and appointed him to receive; which he had, or did accept of great part; and at ſeveral times after, upon that Warrant, at his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt, I did pay him, and order him to receive upon that Warrant, in all, the ſum of about 1700 <hi>l.</hi> and but 1000 <hi>l.</hi> of that is entred in my account; ſo that there is about 700 <hi>l.</hi> of that at money in his hands, for ought I know to this day. One other time when he brought a Warrant for about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> for that Regiment, at the ſame time there was at my houſe a party of Horſe which came for the like ſum upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as I remember belonging to the late Protectors Regiment; and they did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to have that money which I had, which in all was at that time, as neer as I could eſtimate, about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> And whilſt my ſelf, the Agent for the Army, and both parties were in a lower room of my houſe, parling which party ſhould have it, or whether my money ſhould be divided between the two Regiments, this <hi>Chillen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> went out of the room with ſome or all his party, and went to a Lock-Smith, and borrowed iron inſtruments, and then with his party got privately up into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the money was in a great cheſt with three locks, and broke it open, and took &amp; carried away all the money, unknown to me; which, as neer as I could eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, was as aforeſaid about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; I heard preſently that he was gon to an Inne in town with all the money. Whereupon I ſent for him to bring back the money, which he did not, but came himſelf with one or two more, and told me, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that there was but about 2100 <hi>l.</hi> which I was forced to accept of a Receipt or Diſcharge for no more: ſo that at that time in all likelihood, I loſt about 900 <hi>l.</hi> he did alſo at his coming out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to blind the Committee for the Army, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach 500 <hi>l.</hi> of my money in the treaſury at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> whereupon I put in Bayl to anſwer the ſuit, and in time had Judgement againſt him, and demanded my mony of all the treaſurers: but by reaſon there was money due to Alderman <hi>Allen,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which Capt. <hi>Chillenden</hi> had in his hands, Alderman <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Chillenden</hi> were then ſo powerful, that though <hi>I</hi> put in Bail, and had Judgement againſt <hi>Chillenden,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> could not get my 500 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Capt. <hi>Diſher</hi> by cunning deceit and lies got into his hands, and hath it to this day, the ſum of 600 <hi>l.</hi> which doth belong to the Commonwealth, and neer or about 100 <hi>l.</hi> due from him to my ſelf. Lt. <hi>Sheres</hi> by telling an untruth got into his hands, and for ought <hi>I</hi> know keeps it to this day, about 170 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Warrant in Capt. <hi>Blackwel</hi>'s hands for the payment of 264 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s</hi> due to me for Biſeet, which <hi>I</hi> have been and am much damnified for want of.</p>
               <p>Many other things might be related and inſerted, but too large, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us no longer jangle, nor force one another about Religion or Worſhip, for it is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of GOD onely and his Spirit, that brings and leads into all truth, and makes us of one faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And let us all in that power and ſpirit wait to be taught by him, and let us not quench the Spirit in our ſelves nor others; and doubt ye not but the LORD will ſend Labourers enough into his harveſt: The Kingdom is His, the Power is His, and let all Glory and Praiſe be given to Him. <hi>AMEN, AMEN.</hi>
